Alert 2 terminated at 2127 and aircraft taxied to gate.  DTW airfield ops dispatch was later called on 3/16/20 by delta maintenance and was informed that bird remains were found in BOTH engines. Both engines may need to be replaced. EDIT: Ops specialist was initially told by Delta Maintenance that the sample was from a bird strike that happened after departure at KBDL. FAA strike report was first submitted to reflect such until speaking with C Cousineau (KBDL Wildlife Services) who gathered more information from Delta and relayed that information to KDTW wildlife biologist, S Creed. He stated he was told that ONE engine needed to be replaced. Selena spoke with Delta Maintenance at DTW and they said both engines were cleaned, inspected, and determined to be okay. So sorry about all of miscommunication on this one...Smithsonian Wildlife Identification Comments: Bag 1, engine 1, Common Goldeneye Bag 2, engine 2, Common Goldeneye",""

Wayne County Airport Authority later received an MOR stating that there was damage to the right wing of the aircraft as a result of the bird strike.  Airfield Ops management made follow up calls and sent follow up emails the following day to gather more information due to internal records not indicating that this was a damaging strike.  Airfield Ops Specialists stated that the initial call came through 20 minutes after the aircraft landed and that flight crew and maintenance were not available to speak to when they arrived at the gate. They stated that they inspected the aircraft and did not find any evidence of a bird strike or damage on the aircraft. Delta Maintenance stated that they had no records of that aircraft having any bird strikes in the past two days and that no aircraft were out for service due to a bird strike. Lastly, Delta Chief Pilot reached out to the pilot of that aircraft and confirmed that strike remains were found on the slat and that maintenance wiped the aircraft down and stated that there was NO damage to the slat. A barn swallow and a killdeer were found on inspection. Since the strike evidence was wiped off the aircraft before we could take a snarge sample, we can't be 100% sure on ID. Due to the number of Barn swallow strikes we have been receiving on RWY22R and the condition of the carcasses, we feel confident that the bird involved was the barn swallow rather than the killdeer. A separate and unrelated report for the killdeer will be filed. Right wing slat.
